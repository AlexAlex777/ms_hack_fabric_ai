A dermatologist can help you control your acne, avoid scarring or other damage to your skin, and make scars less noticeable. Prescription-strength medications may be prescribed, which can include topical medications and drugs taken orally. Topical medications commonly used for acne include retinoids (such as tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene) and antibiotics (often combined with benzoyl peroxide). It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments with your doctor. Additionally, therapies such as light therapy, chemical peels, and drainage/extraction procedures may be considered. Regular follow-up appointments with your doctor are recommended until your skin improves.\nUser:  What are the symptoms of dermatitis?\n                    doc_title  similarities\n12  Atopic dermatitis KB.docx      0.884214\n10  Atopic dermatitis KB.docx      0.879574\n11  Atopic dermatitis KB.docx      0.870341\nAI:  The symptoms of dermatitis, specifically atopic dermatitis (eczema), can vary from person to person. Here are some common symptoms:\n\n1. Dry, cracked skin: The affected skin may appear dry, rough, and scaly.\n\n2. Itchiness (pruritus): Itching is a hallmark symptom of dermatitis. The urge to scratch can be intense and may worsen the condition.\n\n3. Rash on swollen skin: A red, inflamed rash may develop on the skin. The appearance of the rash can vary depending on the individual's skin color.\n\n4. Small, raised bumps (on brown or Black skin): These bumps, known as papules, may be present on the skin.\n\n5.

This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.\\n\\nFood allergies.\\xa0People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).\\n\\nChronic itchy, scaly skin.\\xa0A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.\\n\\nPatches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area.\\xa0This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.\\n\\nSkin infections.\\xa0Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.\\n\\nIrritant hand dermatitis.\\xa0This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.\\nDocument 2: Atopic dermatitis (eczema)\\n\\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious.\\n\\nPeople with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma.\\n\\nMoisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:\\n\\nDry, cracked skin\\n\\nItchiness (pruritus)\\n\\nRash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color\\n\\nSmall, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin\\n\\nOozing and crusting\\n\\nThickened skin\\n\\nDarkening of the skin around the eyes\\n\\nRaw, sensitive skin from scratching\\n\\nAtopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.\\n\\nWhen to see a doctor\\n\\nTalk with a health care provider if you or your child:\\n\\nHas symptoms of atopic dermatitis\\n\\nIs so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities\\n\\nHas a skin infection — look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs\\n\\nHas symptoms even after trying self-care steps\\nDocument 3: Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities\\n\\nHas a skin infection — look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs\\n\\nHas symptoms even after trying self-care steps\\n\\nSeek immediate medical attention\\xa0if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nIn some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors — such as tobacco smoke.\\n\\nIn other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.\\n\\nA weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.\\n\\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nThe main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.\\n\\nComplications\\n\\nComplications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:\\n\\nAsthma and hay fever.\\xa0Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.\"},\n {'role': 'user', 'content': 'How should I treat my acne?'},\n {'role': 'assistant',\n  'content': \"If you have tried over-the-counter acne products and they haven't helped, it is recommended to consult with a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment options. A dermatologist can help you control your acne, avoid scarring or other damage to your skin, and make scars less noticeable. Prescription-strength medications may be prescribed, which can include topical medications and drugs taken orally. Topical medications commonly used for acne include retinoids (such as tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene) and antibiotics (often combined with benzoyl peroxide). It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments with your doctor. Additionally, therapies such as light therapy, chemical peels, and drainage/extraction procedures may be considered. Regular follow-up appointments with your doctor are recommended until your skin improves.\"},\n {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the symptoms of dermatitis?'},\n {'role': 'assistant',\n  'content': \"The symptoms of dermatitis, specifically atopic dermatitis (eczema), can vary from person to person.
